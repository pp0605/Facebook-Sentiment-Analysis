This project report outlines the creation of a real-time data streaming system using Apache Kafka and Python.

With todayâ€™s emphasis on instant data processing, the project aims to provide a practical solution for handling continuous streams of information. The system is divided into two main parts: producers, which generate the data, and consumers, which process it. Apache Kafka acts as the intermediary, offering reliability and efficiency in message transmission.Python was selected for its ease of use and extensive support libraries. The report details the setup of Kafka clusters and the development of producer and consumer applications using Python. Additionally, it explores key features of Kafka, such as partitioning and fault tolerance, and discusses challenges faced during implementation. By sharing insights and future considerations, this project aims to assist developers and data engineers in creating effective real-time data streaming applications using Apache Kafka and Python.
